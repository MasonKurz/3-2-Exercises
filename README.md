We learned how to use different data types to run a scenario program. In doing so, we learned about what data types to use (int vs double) and how to assign and reassign values. We learned how to model problems and use mathematical operations to produce desired values (profit, average profit, total eggs/chickens). We also brushed on functions and bits.
